# Sensing Stress with Arduino
_Using a Heart Beat Sensor to measure stress levels in the human body_

This project is designed to measure heartbeat with an Arduino with heart beat sensor module.
The Arduino then does a Fast Hartley Transform (FFH, alternative for Fourier) transform to generate the Heart-Rate-Variability (HRV) values.
Based on these values, a relatively accurate indication of the stress levels can be found.

This edited and extended version of code was written by Gerke van Garderen, https://gerkevangarderen.nl/.
It is written as an extension of existing heart rate sensor code, to add stress sensing through monitoring of Heart Rate Variability (HRV).


**Heart rate sensor code is copied from: Pulse Sensor Amped 1.4** by Joel Murphy and Yury Gitman of http://www.pulsesensor.com.
For the original Pulse Sensor Amped code and license of said code, please see: 
https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensor_Amped_Arduino/blob/master/

Change made:
Added the HRV-calculations and display in the design, as well as shortening of the original Heart Rate Sensor code to preserve resources on the Arduino.

**Note: Code is based on Arduino Pro Mini. If you use a different arduino, some changes to port numbers need to be made.
Also, because this code makes use of Timer2, pins 3 and 11 lose PWM-functionality.**
